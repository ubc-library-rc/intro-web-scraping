# Setup

To illustrate web scraping concepts this workshop uses the Chrome browser and the Data Miner plugin. We encourage you to install them to participate in the workshop activities:

1. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.ca/chrome/)
2. The [Data Miner](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/data-scraper-easy-web-scr/nndknepjnldbdbepjfgmncbggmopgden) browser plugin for Chrome

Data Miner requires you to create a free account with their service by logging in through Google. If you are uncomfortable doing this you will still be able to follow along without Data Miner.
{: .note}

All data scraped through Data Miner is stored locally on your computer and never leaves your computer.
