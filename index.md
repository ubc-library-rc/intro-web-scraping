# Setup

To illustrate web scraping concepts this workshop uses the Data Miner plugin available for Chrome and Edge browsers. We encourage you to install Data Miner and a compatible browser to participate in the workshop activities:

1. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.ca/chrome/) or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
2. The [Data Miner](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/data-scraper-easy-web-scr/nndknepjnldbdbepjfgmncbggmopgden) browser plugin for Chrome

Data Miner requires you to create a free account with their service by logging in through Google. If you are uncomfortable doing this you will still be able to follow along without Data Miner.

All data scraped through Data Miner is stored locally on your computer and never leaves your computer.
