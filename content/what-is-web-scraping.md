# What is web scraping?

Two approaches:
* Saving the guts of a website and then working on that output in order to clean it and make it useable
* Directly interacting with the website to get content out of it programmatically

In both cases you are essentially targeting html elements to get a certain type of information out of a website.

Example: "save as" a web page.

Example:

# When is it useful?
Most of the time a website that has underlying data it wants you to be able to work with will make it available to you through an API (Application Programming Interface). If an API is available it's generally a better way to get well formatted data out of a resource and skip a few steps.

# Ethics and considerations
It is not always legal to scrape. Just because something is online does not mean it is free to scrape. There are grey areas -- when in doubt get in touch with a librarian or reach out directly to our Copyright office.

Web scraping can be resource intensive on a server.
