# Web page structure

Effective web scraping requires at least a basic understanding of how web pages are structured. 

HTTPS - hypertext transfer protocol secure

A web browser works by understanding HTTP/HTTPS and knowing how to represent it.

GET - most common http method, retrieve a resource from server. This is what comes into play when you to go a url with a web browser.
POST - send data to server
HEAD - just get the head of a resource without the full content (great for figuring out what it is)

HTML - hypertext markup language
