## Python Activity

For this activity we will be working in [UBC Syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/). Syzygy is a collection of research tools that are accessible through a web browser. One of these tools is "Jupyter" which is an electronic notebook that lets you run scripts in common programming languages and see the output immediately with no additional installation or setup required.

1. Please log in to [UBC Syzygy here](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/). Click on the red house and log in via UBC CWL.
