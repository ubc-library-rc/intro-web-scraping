# Tools and approaches

Python is a common programming language and has a number of tools inside of it that help with web scraping.

The most common Python based tools for web scraping that you are likely to run into are:
* requests
  * a library for getting small snippets of data from the web.
  * tools to communicate over HTTP
* lxml
  * a library for parsing html and xml
* Scrapy
  * a framework for web crawling and web scraping. For getting small and large amounts of data from the web and automating requests to happen repeatedly or over time.
  * A parser which processes html or xml by standardizing it. Beautiful soup can troubleshoot structural problems in the output of your scrape such missing or open html tags.
* urllib
  * tools to communicate over HTTP
  * best for smaller amounts of data, very similar to requests
